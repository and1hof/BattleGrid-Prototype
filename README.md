# BattleGrid
A clone of "Megaman Battle Network", a TGC/TPS/RTS hybrid released in the early 2000's.

### HOW TO PLAY

### WHATS IMPLEMENTED
- Player Controller
- Basic AI Controllers
- Game Board
- UI
- Basic Graphics & Animations

### TODO
- Refactor code for added modularity (so more enemies can be implemented)
- Refactor game board into "tiles" rather than one game board (so we can implement alternative tiles, ex. ice)
- Improve heuristics algorithm for AI
- Implement Megaman Battle Network Sprites & Animations
- Bullet projectiles instead of hitscan
- Implement actual MMBN assets rather than generic Megaman Assets (they are all spritesheets)
